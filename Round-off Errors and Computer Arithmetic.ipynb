    "Let's have an overview first of how a computer works. There are only two letters, called *bits*, in the computer \"alphabet\" and these are 0 and 1. A sequence or a string of zeroes and ones are used to represent characters including numbers and letters. To represent real numbers, a string of 64 bits is used. The first bit indicates the sign (positive or negative) of the real number. This is followed by 11 bits that represent the exponent of 2, called the **characteristic**. The remaining 52 bits represents a binary fraction called the **mantissa**. If we let $s$ be the sign, $c$ be the characteristic and $f$ be the mantissa we will have the a unique representation of real numbers given by \n",

    "## Topic 2 (Round-off Errors). (Study time: 10 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer can only represent numbers in a finite number of digits. For example, $\\frac{1}{3}\\approx 0.33333333$ and $\\pi\\approx 3.141\\ 159\\ 653\\ 589\\ 79$ depending on the precision of the computer. The double-precision floating-point format can represent real numbers up to 17 correct digits similar to the way $\\pi$ was previously described. In addition, not all real numbers can be represented using the double-precision format. In the previous example, the number $1.0000000000000002$ represents the numbers in the interval $$(1,1.0000000000000002]$$ since it is the smallest number greater than 1. These limitations in the computing power result in what we call as *round-off error*. To examine these situations, we will use the more familiar *decimal machine numbers*.\n",

    "**Definition (Normalized Decimal Floating-point Form:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The normalized decinal floating-point form is given by $$\\pm 0.d_1d_2\\ldots d_k\\times 10^n,\\ n\\in\\mathbb{Z}$$ where $1\\leq d_1\\leq 9$ and $0\\leq d_i\\leq 9$ for $i=2,\\ldots, k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any positive real number that can be represented by a computer can be normalized to the form $$y=0.d_1d_2\\ldots d_kd_{k+1}d_{k+2}\\ldots\\times 10^n.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The floating-point form of $y$, denoted by $fl(y)$, is obtained by terminating $y$ at $k$ decimal digits. This termination is commonly done in two ways:\n",
    "1. by **chopping** and\n",
    "2. by **rounding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chopping is done by simply removing off the decimal digits starting at $d_{k+1}$ and onwards. On the other hand, rounding follows the rule that if $d_{k+1}<5$, we perfom chopping starting at $d_{k+1}$ while if $d_{k+1}\\geq 5$, we add $1$ to $d_k$ and chop off the digits starting at $d_{k+1}.$ Let's illustrate the processes in the next example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine the $5$-digit (a) chopping and (b) rounding values of  the irrational number $e$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Solution:* The number $e$ is a non-terminating and non-repeating decimal of the form $e=2.718281828459\\ldots$. Converting this into the normalized decimal floating-point form, we have $$e=0.2718281828459\\ldots\\times 10^1.$$ Thus,\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) the floating-point form of $e$ using $5$-digit chopping is $$fl(e)=0.27182\\times 10^1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) For the $5$-digit rounding, note that the sixth digit of the normalized form is $8\\geq 5$. Thus, we add $1$ to the fifth digit and obtain the floating-point form of $e$ as $$fl(e)=0.27183\\times 10^1.$$ Both floating-point forms of $e$ are approximations to the actual value of $e$. Hence, the processes of obtaining $fl(e)$ results in approximation errors. There are two ways to measure this error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition (Absolute and Relative Error):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that $p^*$ is an approximation to $p$. The *absolute error* is $$|p-p^*|$$ and the *relative error* is $$\\frac{|p-p^*|}{|p|}$$ provided that $p\\neq 0.$\n",

    "*Solution:* The absolute error for (a) is $10$, for (b) is $0.01$ and for (c) is $1000$ while the relative error for all item is $0.01$.\n",
