    "   Let $f$ be a function defined on an open interval $I$ of real numbers except possibly at $x_0\\in I$. The real number $L$ is said to be the *limit* of $f$ at $x_0$, written $$\\lim_{x\\to x_0}f(x)=L,$$ if for any real number $\\epsilon>0$, there exists a real number $\\delta>0$ such that $$|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon$$ whenever $x\\in I$ and $0<|x-x_0|<\\delta$.\n",

    " From the definition of the limit alone, we can identify some important ideas that will arise as we progress in the course. Suppose that the limit $L$ exists but we cannot solve it directly using classical techniques. The best way for us to approximate the value of $L$ is to identify the behavior of the function values $f(x)'s$ as $x$ approaches $x_0$ from the left and the right. Hence, we can think of the $f(x)'s$ as *approximations* for $L$. What about $\\epsilon$? Consider the example below.\n",
